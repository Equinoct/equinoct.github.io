      <p>The Tidal Calender application allows residents
         of coastal regions affected by tidal flooding to upload relevant data and media. This data
         will be used for research and co-creating community solutions for the worsening tidal situation
         we are faced with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, only the android version of the application is in existence. The web and iOS versions
        are under development, and will be available at this website soon. You will be required to use
        an email address to register your account on the application.
